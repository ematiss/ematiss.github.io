					<h5>SGPS Graduate Student Trustee Campaign</h5>
					<p>
						Hello SGPS members,
						I'm excited to announce my candidacy for Graduate Student Trustee!<br>
						<br>

						After four years in Senate and a year serving as SGPS President, I am excited to announce my candidacy for Graduate Student Trustee as my final contribution to student governance at Queen’s. Over the past five years, I have gained invaluable experience and built strong relationships that I hope to leverage to advocate effectively for graduate and professional students.
					</p>
					<p>

						As Trustee, my goal would be to bring our voices to the Board of Trustees, ensuring that the needs and concerns of our community are not only heard but acted upon. I have demonstrated my commitment to this approach when I led the 24-25 SGPS Executive in successfully advocating against cuts to the QGA, coordinating with stakeholders across the university, and presenting evidence that protected critical funding for our students. This achievement was only possible through the collaboration of many, and I firmly believe that working together is the key to success. My focus now is to ensure the QGA remains protected for years to come, safeguarding the financial stability of graduate students.<br>
						<br>


						I am passionate about representing you and working collaboratively to steer Queen’s toward decisions that reflect our shared values of equity, excellence, and community. I hope you will place your trust in me, and I look forward to continuing to serve and advocate for our collective future.
					</p>

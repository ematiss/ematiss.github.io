					<h5>SGPS Campaign</h5>
					<p>
						I have a long history of involvement in university governance throughout my entire graduate
						student journey. I started
						by representing students at the departmental level, at the Centre for Neuroscience Studies, and
						later became the chair
						of our student leadership committee in the subsequent year. I then took on the role of graduate
						student senator, where I
						chaired the student senate caucus and a senate committee in my second year. I ran successfully
						for re-election for both
						the senate and student senate caucus chair positions. I briefly considering running for graduate
						student trustee to take
						on new challenges, but I enjoyed the role of academic oversight at senate. Ultimately, I decided
						to run for SGPS
						president. This role offers me an opportunity to broaden my responsibilities, as it involves
						serving on the senate, the
						board of trustees, and the university council, all while maintaining a strong position for
						student advocacy.
					</p>
					<p>
						As SGPS president, I will work to address the following issues:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Decentralization:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>The university's decentralized, vertical, structure hinders information sharing.
								</li>
								<li>Working to streamline communication channels.</li>
								<li>Strengthening administration and student leader communication.</li>
								<li>Improving transparency and accountability.</li>
								<li>Supporting and expanding SGPS community initiatives.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Cost of Living Crisis:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Rising living costs in Kingston while we have stagnant stipends and scholarships.
								</li>
								<li>Advocating for increased funding packages.</li>
								<li>Exploring partnerships with the city.</li>
								<li>Seeking solutions within budget constraints, including lobbying for greater
									provincial
									government support.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Mental Health:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Financial and academic stress impact mental health.</li>
								<li>Prioritizing mental health resources and support systems.</li>
								<li>Evaluating and improving existing mental health support strategies.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
